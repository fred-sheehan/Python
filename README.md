# This repo contains:

## A folder for app brewery course:

Python 100 days of code
With course work python files written to work in a local testing environment, right from the first few days of the course.

## A folder containing short pieces of code:

Python code snippets that I have wanted to keep for future reference, and to save me having to keep looking up the same things. These are all in the `code_snippets` folder.

## A folder for my own projects:

Python projects that I have worked on, or am working on.
There are several terminal applications that will need python installed to use, and a few apps that have been compiled into standalone executables that should work anywhere, without needing a local python environment.

There are even a few games, most of which, once completed, will also be turned into standalone executables.
