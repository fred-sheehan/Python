## A collection of small Python3 games

You will need to have Python 3 installed to run the games here, and you can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

The games were written with version 3.12 of Python, which was the most up to date version at the time of writing, though they should run on any version of Python 3 greater than version 3.8.

Some of the games and apps will run directly in a terminal, and if the games use a GUI, they were written utilising the Turtle Grphics library that comes pre-installed with Python.

Unfortunately, many 2 player games can't properly be supported without using 2 seperate game controllers, and as creating these games was more about the learning process, and so all designed to be played with a keyboard, this does cause some issues.

For example, when playing the 'Classic Pong Game', using different keys for different players isn't really practical.
The way keyboards are designed to work, if you hold down a key, it will 'Block' another key from being used at the same time.

This does mean that a player can 'Cheat' in that they can hold down a key, and then the other player can't use any keys. I might see if I can fix it later, but I suspect that would mean the games would need controller support, for the reasons already stated.

I might try experementing with using keys that are designed not to block others, like the ALT or CMD keys for example, but I'm not sure how well that would work, or even if it would be possible, without interfering with the underlying OS.

I hope you enjoy the games, and if you have any suggestions, or find any bugs, please let me know.
